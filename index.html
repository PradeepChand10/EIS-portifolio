              <p>In a team of four, I took the responsibility to design payment page and form charts in master page to give insights to vendors and customers of dining services at USF. This application enables customers to easily check all the available dining options and food available at each dining service. From business perspectives it can be easily scaled up and developed as food ordering application. Moreover, from the sales owners of dining services will be able order inventory and customers get to know most famous item at each service.</p>

              <p>The project involves generating an exploratory data analysis (EDA) to study the influence of lifestyle habits, sex, and age on diabetes in the United States. The analysis was enhanced using an AdaBoost model, achieving an area under the curve (AUC) of 94%. As we are just developing a predictive model it can be easily used various applications in healthcare sector just by training corresponding datasets. Moreover, the correlation analysis helps people in understanding the associations of diabetis with habits of people.</p>

            <h5>Human-Centered Artificial Intelligence and Workforce Displacement</h5>
            <p class="section_text_p3">Artificial intelligence (AI) is changing the global economy, offering significant advances in productivity and efficiency. However, as AI and automation rise, they bring challenges like workforce displacement and economic disparity. One of the most affected industries is manufacturing, which has traditionally relied on human labor for tasks like assembly and quality control. With AI-powered robots and automated systems, production becomes more efficient and costs are reduced. Yet, this shift threatens many jobs. Studies show that a large percentage of tasks across various occupations could be automated with current technologies.</p>
            <p class="section_text_p3">For companies, the integration of AI means balancing technological benefits with the impact on employees. It's crucial for businesses to invest in retraining and upskilling programs to prepare their workforce for new roles alongside AI. This not only helps retain jobs but also drives innovation and adaptability within the organization. Human-centered AI design is essential, focusing on creating systems that support and enhance human work rather than replacing it. For example, in healthcare, AI can provide advanced diagnostic tools, allowing doctors to focus more on patient care and complex decisions.</p>
            <p class="section_text_p3">The demand for professionals skilled in AI, machine learning, and data analytics is growing, creating new career opportunities. However, workers in traditional roles face challenges if they lack these new skills. Therefore, educational institutions and businesses need to develop training programs to help the workforce adapt. Lifelong learning and continuous skill development are becoming key to career growth. By prioritizing human-centered AI, investing in employee training, and encouraging a culture of innovation, businesses can harness the benefits of AI while mitigating its negative impacts, ensuring that technology enhances human capabilities and contributes to a fair and prosperous society.</p>
